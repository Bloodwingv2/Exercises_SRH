# Machine Learning Individual Exercises (Master's Statistics Course)

A collection of supervised learning exercises covering decision trees and practical machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project contains two individual exercises:

- **Exercise 1: Decision Tree** - Implementation and analysis of decision tree algorithms
- **Exercise 2: Supervised Learning** - Practical applications of supervised learning methods

### Datasets

- `iris.csv` - Classic Iris dataset for classification tasks
- `Housing.csv` - Housing dataset for regression analysis

## Quick Start with UV

Get started immediately using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

### 1. Install UV
```bash
pip install uv
```

### 2. Sync Dependencies
```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).

### 3. Run Exercises

Open and execute the Jupyter notebooks:
- `Exercises/Individual_exercise_1_Decision_tree.ipynb`
- `Exercises/Individual_exercise_2_Supervised_Learning.ipynb`

## Requirements

- Python >=3.13
- pandas >=3.0.0
- scikit-learn >=1.8.0
- matplotlib >=3.10.8
